# Setup

- Open `scss/style.scss` and change the width and height to the values of your screen (I've created simple function that should make the widgets on your device look no different from those on mine, however if anything looks out of place simply adjust them however you want to)
- Open `data/shell/wb.sh` and change the `browser` variable to the command for opening your default browser
- Open `data/shell/opn.sh` and adjust all the variables defined at the top so that they match your system paths
- Open `library/values.js` and change the `city` to the name of the city you live in
- Open `data/shell/mails.py, and adjust the email and password to your creds, as well as change the python interpreter path if needed (the `#!` at the top)
